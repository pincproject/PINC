/**
 * @brief Contains a population of particles.
 *
 * The position and velocity of particles is stored in a flat manner, such that
 * (x,y,z) of particle 0 comes first, then (x,y,z) of particle 1, and so on
 * (assuming 3D). As an example, printing the (x,y,z) position of the first 3
 * particles:
 *
 * @code
 *	Population pop;
 *  ...
 *	for(int i=0;i<3;i++){
 *		double *iPos = &pop.pos[i*pop.nDims];
 *		printf("Particle %i is located at (%f,%f,%f).\n",i,iPos[0],iPos[1],iPos[2]);
 *	}
 * @endcode
 *
 * The subset of particles belonging to specie s start at particle i=iStart[s]
 * and stop at i=iStop[s]-1 (the -1 simplifies many calculations and is more
 * consistent with the C way of counting). Due to particle increase/decrease
 * there is allocated space for more particles than are present. Thus the
 * _allocated_ space for specie s start at i=iStart[s] and stop at
 * i=iStart[s+1]-1. For convenience, iStart has nSpecies+1 elements such that
 * this is true also for the last specie. The last element is then simply the
 * number of particles allocated in total.
 *
 * The position of the particles is normalized with respect to the step size in
 * Grid, such that a particle with local position (1,2,3) is located _on_ node
 * (1,2,3) in the grid. Particles are usually specified in local frame but may
 * temporarily be expressed in global frame. See MpiInfo.
 *
 * kinEnergy and potEnergy stores the kinetic and potential energy of the
 * particles if an energy-computing function is utilized (see e.g. puAcc3D1KE
 * and gPotEnergy). Some energy-computing functions may be able to compute the
 * energy per specie, in which case kinEnergy[s] and potEnergy[s] is the energy
 * for specie s. Others may only be able to compute the net energy for all
 * species, in which case this is stored in the last element (
 * kinEnergy[nSpecies] or potEnergy[nSpecies]). Note that this is only the
 * energy for the current subdomain, and a separate function must be employed
 * to sum the energy across the subdomains and store it to an .h5-file.
 *
 * If a population h5 output file is created, the handler to this file is
 * stored in h5.

/**
 * @brief A grid-valued quantity, for instance charge density or E-field.
 *
 * This datatype can represent both scalar fields and vector fields on an N-
 * dimensional grid. Basically, it can be thought of as an arbitrarily
 * dimensioned array object which is stored flat/linearly in memory but which
 * contains supporting variables in order to work with it efficiently.
 *
 * The values in the array is stored in natural/lexicographical ordering in
 * 'val', such that for a 3D array, the elements has the following order:
 *
 *	(0,0,0), (1,0,0), (2,0,0), ..., (0,1,0), (1,1,0), (2,1,0), ...
 *
 * 'rank' is the number of dimensions of the array, while 'size' is the size
 * along each dimension. A 128x128x128 array therefore has rank=3 and
 * size={128,128,128}. The following is an example of how to access element
 * (a,b,c) in the array:
 *
 * @code
 *	Grid *rho;
 *	...
 *	int *size = rho->size;
 *	long int p = a + b*size[0] + c*size[0]*size[1];
 *	double element = rho->val[p];
 * @endcode
 *
 * For convenience and to speed up computations, 'sizeProd' is the cumulative
 * product of 'size' starting at 1. For our example,
 * sizeProd={1,128,128*128,128*128*128}. Using this, the linear index p in the
 * above code can equivalently be computed as:
 *
 * @code
 *	long int p = a*sizeProd[0] + b*sizeProd[1] + c*sizeProd[2];
 * @endcode
 *
 * Also note that adding sizeProd[d] to a linear index p corresponds to to
 * incrementing one step along dimension d in the array. This can be utilized
 * for speeding up certain calculations. sizeProd[rank] is the total number of
 * elements in the array.
 *
 * While this struct is generic and may store any kind of array, the standard
 * way of storing quantities on a grid in PINC is that the first dimension in
 * the array represents the field component (e.g. x, y or z-component of a 3D
 * electric field) while the consecutive dimensions represents the physical
 * dimensions in the grid. For instance a vector field on a 3D grid of
 * 128x128x128 grid points would be represented by a 3x128x128x128 array of
 * rank 4. This means that all field components are lumped together, stored one
 * grid point at a time. A scalar field on the same grid would be represented by
 * a 1x128x128x128 array also of rank 4. The rank is therefore one more than the
 * number of dimensions of the grid. sizeProd[2], for instance, then represents
 * an increment in y-direction in the grid. The following more involved example
 * prints the 3D vector value E on grid points (2,k,3) for all k avoiding
 * complete re-computation of the linear index p each time:
 *
 * @code
 *	Grid *E;
 *
 *	...
 *
 *	int *size = E->size;
 *	long int *sizeProd = E->sizeProd;
 *
 *	int j = 2;
 *	int l = 3;
 *	long int p = j*sizeProd[1] + l*sizeProd[3];
 *
 *	for(int k=0;k<size[2];k++){
 *
 *		double *value = E->val[p];
 *		printf("E(%i,%i,%i)=(%f,%f,%f)\n",j,k,l,value[0],value[1],value[2]);
 *		p += sizeProd[2];
 *	}
 * @endcode
 *
 * In the case of paralellization through domain decomposition this datatype
 * represents the local sub-domain and an MpiInfo object keeps track of how the
 * sub-domaines are related to one another. In the case of domain decomposition,
 * however, each MPI node will need data on grid points outside of its own
 * sub-domain. Thus the outermost layers of grid points will often be ghost
 * points of neighbouring sub-domains. Also, one might need ghost points for
 * some boundary condition implementations regardless of domain decomposition.
 * In any case, 'nGhostLayers' represents the number of ghost layers at each
 * boundary. For 3D (ND), the first 3 (N) elements of 'nGhostLayers' indicates
 * the number of ghost points along the lower boundaries of dimensions x, y, and
 * z, respectively. The last 3 (N) elements indicates the number of ghost points
 * along the upper boundaries. 'trueSize' indicates how many grid points truly
 * belongs to this sub-domain.
 *
 * Consider for instance a vector field on a sub-domain of 128x128x128 grid
 * padded with 1 layer of ghost nodes along the whole sub-domain. This will lead
 * to the struct having the following member values:
 *	- rank = 4
 *	- size = {3,130,130,130}
 *	- trueSize = {3,128,128,128}
 *	- sizeProd = {1,3,390,50700,6591000}
 *	- nGhostLayers = {0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1}
 *
 * Naturally, domain decomposition doesn't affect the first (non-physical)
 * dimension in the array.
 *
 * 'h5' is a HDF5 file identifier used to store the grid quantity to an .h5-file
 * and are used by gWriteH5(). The other two h5-variables are also used by
 * gWriteH5() since they only needs to be computed once.
 *
 * 'slice' is a buffer which is large enough to store any slice cut through the
 * array using getSlice().

/**
 * @brief Contains characteristic scales to be used for normalization and
 * denormalization in PINC.
 *
 * This datatype contains characteristic scales, in physical units (normally
 * SI), that can be used to normalize or denormalize all quantities in PINC. To
 * normalize a quantity, it is enough to make sure it is dimensionless. E.g. to
 * normalize the thermal velocity [m/s], it is simply divided by units->velocity
 * [m/s] such that it becomes of dimension [1]. It might as well have been
 * divided by units->length/units->time [m/s]. The scales are consistent in such
 * a manner that this gives the same result, although the shorter version is
 * preferred for clarity. Anyhow, as long as it is dimensionless, it is
 * guaranteed to be correctly normalized. Likewise, to denormalize a quantity in
 * dimensionless simulation units, it is sufficient to make sure it has the
 * right dimension. E.g. an electric potential in dimensionless units would be
 * brought to SI units [V] by multiplying with units->potential.
 *
 * The convention when it comes to normalization is that _all_ quantities in the
 * input file is normalized _before_ any computation _or_ initialization takes
 * place that use quantities whith physical units:
 *
 * @code
 * 	Units *units = uAlloc(ini);
 * 	uNormalize(ini, units);
 *
 * 	Grid *rho = gAlloc(ini, SCALAR);
 * 	Population *pop = pAlloc(ini); // Reads pre-normalized charge and mass
 *
 * 	// computations
 *
 * 	pOpenH5(ini, pop, units, "pop");
 * 	gOpenH5(ini, rho, mpiInfo, units, units->chargeDensity, "rho");
 *
 * 	uFree(units);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The quantities are normalized and written back to the ini variable by the
 * uNormalize() function (but it is not written back to the ini-file on disk).
 * The normalization scheme is consistent in such a way that all equations look
 * the same in both physical and normalized units, except that the vacuum
 * permittivity \f$\varepsilon_0\f$ and vacuum permeability \f$\mu_0\f$ becomes
 * one. Moreover, the normalization is such that the spatial and temporal
 * stepsizes also becomes one, \f$\Delta x=\Delta t=1\f$. Therefore, the
 * implementors of computing functions need not worry about normalization. They
 * can use the equations as they are formulated in SI units, discretize them if
 * necessary, and omit the constants \f$\varepsilon_0, \mu_0, \Delta x, \Delta
 * t\f$.
 *
 * Grid and Population quantities are not denormalized before being written to
 * disk. This is because it is cheaper to just change the axis in a plot during
 * post processing, than it would be to denormalize the quantity before writing
 * it to disk and then normalizing it again before continuing to the next
 * time-step. Instead the HDF5 files are provided with denormalization factors
 * having the right physical units such that when the result is multiplied by
 * these factors the result is in physical units. This allows post-processing
 * scripts to infer the right units from the output file alone. For Grid
 * quantities, the right denormalization factor for that quantity must be
 * provided as shown in the above example. The physical units stored in this
 * datatype should basically only be accessed during input and output.
 *
 * uNormalize() normalizes all parts of the ini-file that is part of the core
 * functionality of PINC. Other modules may have separate subsections in the
 * ini-file, and since the core should not depend on the submodules,
 * uNormalize() should _not_ normalize these quantities. Instead, these modules
 * can implement their own normalization functions (e.g. mccNormalize()) which
 * are run directly after uNormalize(). uNormalize() can act as a prototype for
 * these functions.
 *
 * Notice also the distinction between e.g. a hypervolume and a "normal" volume.
 * A volume is normally defined to be of three dimensions (length^3) whereas a
 * hypervolume is of nDims dimensions. For generality this is usually what you
 * want. When you talk about domain volume, or cell volume, you usually mean
 * area if it's 2D, length if it's 1D and (length^4) if its 4D. Likewise, a
 * hyperarea is length^(nDims-1). This is what you get when you take a cross
 * section in nDims dimensions.
 *
 * Although not relevant for most users, several normalization schemes can
 * actually be implemented in PINC, but they must all fulfill these criteria:
 * - \f$\Delta x=\Delta t=1\f$ after normalization. Hence the characteristic
 *   length \f$X\f$ and time \f$T\f$ must be the spatial and temporal stepsizes,
 *   respectively. In particular the interpolation schemes benefit from this,
 *   which is one of PINC's main strengths.
 * - There must only be three base units. Plasma physics (or more generally
 *   electromagnetics) has four base units in the SI system (MKSA -- meter,
 *   kilogram, second and Ampére). However, one is actually unnecessary. Current
 *   can be defined from the first three (MKS). Defining more base units than
 *   necessary leads to inconvenient constants, such as the vacuum permittivity
 *   and permeability in the SI system. To get rid of these constants one must
 *   only specify three base units. An excellent example of such a system is the
 *   Heaviside-Lorentz Units (HLU) where the base units are centimeter, gram and
 *   second (CGS) and in which all constants disappears from Maxwell's equations
 *   (the Gaussian units differ by having additional factors of \f$4\pi\f$).
 *   Likewise for a PIC code, to have as simple equations to work with as
 *   possible, with no constants, one can only define three characteristic
 *   scales, and derive the rest from those. In PINC this will typically be
 *   length, mass and charge (or alternatively mass). The characteristic mass
 *   \f$M\f$ must be related to the other scales as follows:
 *   \f[
 *		M = \frac{T^2Q^2}{\varepsilon_0X^D}
 *   \f]
 *   where \f$D\f$ is the number of spatial dimensions (nDims) and
 *   \f$\varepsilon_0\f$ is the vacuum permittivity in the system of units which
 *   is used in the input file (e.g. 1 for HLU and \f$8.85\cdot 10^{-12}\f$ for
 *   SI). If using SI, \f$X, T, Q\f$ and \f$M\f$ all have they normal units, and
 *   other characteristic scales can be derive from them through dimensional
 *   analysis. This makes sure that the normalization is consistent both in the
 *   sense that the equations are the same after normalization as in SI units
 *   (or actually in HLU units since the vacuum permittivity and permeability
 *   becomes one), and in the sense that if a quantity is dimensionless it is
 *   correctly normalized, and if it has the proper physical dimension then it
 *   is correctly denormalized.
