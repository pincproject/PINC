 *
 * In PINC it is made an distinction between _non-dimensionalizing_ and
 * _normalizing_. Input quantities are non-dimensionalized by specifying them
 * in terms of Debye lengths, plasma frequency, elementary charges and so on
 * rather than using SI-units. Further on, the program normalizes them with
 * respect to for instance cell size in order to make computations as fast as
 * possible. The data stored in .pop.h5 is non-dimensionalized _and_ normalized
 * as it is often much cheaper to just rescale the axes in the visualization
 * tool rather than re-scaling all quantities in PINC.
 *
 * The file will have four attributes of size nDims attached to the root group
 * ("/") which is useful for interpreting the data. These are:
 *	- Position denormalization factor
 *	- Position dimensionalizing factor
 *	- Velocity denormalization factor
 *	- Velocity dimensionalizing factor
 *
 * The position denormalization factor can be multiplied to the integer axis to
 * convert it to be in terms of Debye lengths. Another multiplication by axis
 * dimensionalizing factor converts the axes to meters. Likewise for the
 * velocity factors.
